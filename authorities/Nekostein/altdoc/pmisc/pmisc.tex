\newdochere{INTRODUCTION\\HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Now you are seeing the PMisc document, a PDF built via \LaTeX.
It is generated from ``UNINC.toml'' and ``pmisc.tex'' in the UNINCDB repository.

You might have noticed that using this tool does not necessarily require obtaining a Letter of Witness
for your Charter from Nekostein or any other witness authority.
But for technical robustness, requesting one will be a good idea to keep your local data consistent.

All you need is to make a local git clone and fill up data in the ``/db-private/1970/myorg'' directory.
The usage is straightforward and the scripts are easy to understand.

as the President of unincorporated organization

\underline{\fulltomldataATfullname}

hereby make a solemn declaration of FOUR clauses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I shall exercise Presidential rights in the unincorporated organization owing fiduciary duty to the Charter
        identifiable with the given 160-bit SHA-1 hash:\\
        \underline{\fulltomldataATcharterhash}.
    \item In the event that an organizational resolution, requiring the inauguration of a new President,
        is approved in accordance with the Charter, I shall transfer all Presidential rights,
        as well as any applicable documentation, to the new President.
    \item Any asset that I control on behalf of the organization shall be passed to the new President
        in the event of my resigning, retirement, or death.
    \item In the event that our Charter is being amended, or significant manifest information
        (e.g. President, Secretary, Addresses) is being changed,
        I shall publish an announcement online, and shall notify the following witness authorities,
        as long as they remain operational and free of charge,
        to ensure best possible availability of information.
