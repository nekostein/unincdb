\newdochere{INTRODUCTION\\HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Now you are seeing the PMisc document, a PDF built via \LaTeX.
It is generated from ``UNINC.toml'' and ``pmisc.tex'' in the UNINCDB repository.

In this document, we intend to afford a few pre-made forms
that an unincorporated organization can print and sign/stamp/seal en masse.
For example, the Deed Poll for Assuming Presidential Duty can be instrumental
when convincing a third party that any liability that may possibly emerge
will at least be handled by the President in person.

You might have noticed that using this tool does not necessarily require obtaining a Letter of Witness
for your Charter from Nekostein or any other witness authority.
All you need is to make a local git clone and fill up data in the ``/db-private/1970/myorg'' directory.
The usage is straightforward and the scripts are easy to understand.

But for technical robustness, requesting a Letter of Witness will be a good idea to keep your local data consistent.
If the Charter is witnessed by the Nekostein-hosted UNINCDB,
this PDF should be available at the following URL:

        is approved in accordance with the Charter, I shall transfer all Presidential rights,
        as well as any applicable documentation, to the new President.
    \item Any asset that I control on behalf of the organization shall be passed to the new President
        in the event of my resigning, retirement, or death.
    \item In the event that our Charter is being amended, or significant manifest information
        (e.g. President, Secretary, Addresses) is being changed,
        I shall publish an announcement online, and shall notify the following witness authorities,
        as long as they remain operational and free of charge,
        to ensure best possible availability of information.
